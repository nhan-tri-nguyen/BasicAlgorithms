dhck
dkhc

Sample Output 0:
ba
no answer

dhkc
hcdk

Explanation 0:

Not possible to rearrange bb and get a lexicographically greater string.
Test case 3: 
hegf is the next string lexicographically greater than hefg.
Test case 4: 
dhkc is the next string lexicographically greater than dhck.
Test case 5:
