A Codeforces problem

Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.

He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer 洧녵. Initially the value of 洧녵 equals to 洧녺 and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer 洧논 that 洧논 < 洧녵 and 洧논 is not a divisor of 洧녵, then subtract 洧논 from 洧녵. The goal of the player is to minimize the value of 洧녵 in the end.

Sample input: 8
Sample output: 1

Note
In the first example, the player can choose 洧논 = 3 in the first turn, then 洧녵 becomes 5. He can then choose 洧논 = 4 in the second turn to get 洧녵 = 1 as the result. There are other ways to get this minimum. However, for example, he cannot choose 洧논 = 2 in the first turn because 2 is a divisor of 8.
