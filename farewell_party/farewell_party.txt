A Codeforces problem

Chouti and his classmates are going to the university soon. To say goodbye to each other, the class has planned a big farewell party in which classmates, teachers and parents sang and danced.

Chouti remembered that 𝑛 persons took part in that party. To make the party funnier, each person wore one hat among 𝑛 kinds of weird hats numbered 1,2,…𝑛. It is possible that several persons wore hats of the same kind. Some kinds of hats can remain unclaimed by anyone.

After the party, the 𝑖-th person said that there were 𝑎𝑖 persons wearing a hat differing from his own.

It has been some days, so Chouti forgot all about others' hats, but he is curious about that. Let 𝑏𝑖 be the number of hat type the 𝑖-th person was wearing, Chouti wants you to find any possible 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛 that doesn't contradict with any person's statement. Because some persons might have a poor memory, there could be no solution at all.
